# Timestamp Microservice

This project is built using Express and tests for a date to be passed to it as a parameter. It will test if that is a valid date and return the information in an object with the natural language and unix timestamp. If the parameter passed to it is not a date, it will return the same object with both keys being populated with null values.

The live version of the project can be found at https://dslemay-timestamp.herokuapp.com
